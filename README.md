Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms practice repository! This repository is dedicated to improving my understanding and implementation of various data structures and algorithms using TypeScript/JavaScript.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to practice and master different data structures and algorithms. It serves as a personal playground to experiment with different techniques and improve problem-solving skills.

## Contents

The repository contains implementations and practice problems for the following (maybe not all are available if you are taking a look to this repo when I recently created):

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)**
- **Graphs**
- **Heaps**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)**
- **Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, etc.)**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Recursion**

## Languages and Tools

- **TypeScript**
- **JavaScript**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

4. Run dev:
    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```
